        <li>hat are the new tags added in HTML5?</li>

        <li> How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</li>
        &#10146; To embed audio in HTML, we use the audio tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge in three audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG. Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio format. <br>
        <h2>Click play button to play audio</h2>
<audio src="./test.mp3" controls></audio><br>
        
        &#10146; To embed video in HTML, we use the video tag. It contains one or more video sources at a time using source tag. It supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg in all modern browsers. Only Ogg video format doesn’t support in Safari browser. <br>
        <h2>Click play button to play video</h2>
<video src="./test.mp4" controls></video>  <br>
        
        <li> Semantic element in HTML5?</li>
        &#10146; A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

        Examples of non-semantic elements: div  and span - Tells nothing about its content.
        
        Examples of semantic elements: form , table , and article - Clearly defines its content. <br>
         
        Semantic Elements in HTML  <br>

        aside <br>
        details <br>
        figcaption <br>
        figure <br>
        footer <br>
        header <br>
        main <br>
        mark <br>
        nav <br>
        section <br>
        summary <br>
        time
        
        <li>Canvas and SVG tags</li>
        &#10146; Canvas : <br>
        The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images. <br>
        &#10146; SVG : <br>
        Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web. Unlike raster images (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality. An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema — that means SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad. There are several other advantages of using SVG over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.
